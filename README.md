```
{
   "available": [<list of unoccupied rooms>],
   "reserved": [<list of occupied rooms>],
   "date": <today's date>,
}
```
> For instance: 
```JSON

{
    "available": [
        {

# Making POST Requests

To make POST requests to protected endpoints, such as booking a room, you need to obtain an authentication token, specifically a JSON Web Token (JWT). Follow the steps below:
1. **User Registration:**
   - Endpoint: `/api/register/`
   - Method: POST
   - Description: Register a new user to obtain authentication credentials.
   - Parameters:
     - `username` (string): Desired username for the new user.
     - `password` (string): Password for the new user.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "your_username", "password": "your_password"}' http://your-domain/api/register/
     ```
   - Response:
     ```json
     {
        "username": "your_username",
        "id": 2
     }
     ```

2. **Token Acquisition:**
   - Endpoint: `/api/token/`
   - Method: POST
   - Description: Obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT) by providing the registered user's credentials.
   - Parameters:
     - `username` (string): Username of the registered user.
     - `password` (string): Password of the registered user.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "your_username", "password": "your_password"}' http://your-domain/api/token/
     ```
   - Response:
     ```json
     {
        "access": "your_access_token",
        "refresh": "your_refresh_token"
     }
     ```

     3. **Use the Token for Booking:**
   - After obtaining the access token, include it in the Authorization header for subsequent requests.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token" -d '{"room_name": "101", "start": "2024-01-24", "end": "2024-01-26"}' http://your-domain/api/book/room/
     ```
   - Response:
     ```json
     {
        "message": "Booking successful for you",
        "room": 2,
        "room_name": "101",
        "start": "2024-01-24",
        "end": "2024-01-26"
     }
     ```

   
**Note:**
- Keep your tokens secure.
- Access tokens have a limited lifespan, but you can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token when needed.
- Only superuser can add(create) rooms

### Install Docker

1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your computer.
2. If Docker is not installed, you can download it [from here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and install it according to the instructions for your operating system.

### Start the project
### We have already entered the repositories with `pipenv` before, now we will continue with the next one, but you first enter your `Docker Desktop` application if you do not have `Linux` of course:
1. Create a Docker image by running the command: 
    ```
    $ docker build -t BookingApi .
    ```
2. Once the image has been successfully created, start the container: 
    ```
    $ docker run -p 1212:8000 BookingApi
    ```
3. Check ``Dockerfile`` if you do not have an image download from ``Docker Hub``:
    ````bash
    $ docker pull python:3.11-alpine
    ````

Your project should now be available in your browser at `https://localhost:1212/api/rooms`. - Here `api/rooms` means this from application Django.

5. List of rooms:
    ```
    https://localhost:1212/api/rooms
    ```
